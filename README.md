# Real Time Bus Tracking 

This exercise was made in week 9 of the MIT Full Stack Developer Program. 
The goal of this project was to track the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.
 Mapbox and MBTA API were used in this project. 

  




## How to run
First: Press the Show stops between MIT and Harvard button for the 
map marker to begin moving to each bus stop on the map.
Second: Press the pause button when youâ€™ve reached the bus stop 
you're interested in.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I want to add the direct address of the stop when your mouse hovers 
over the map marker for future improvements.
